I want to mention that this is a work based on a youtber under the channel @Travesy Media, most of the code isn't orginally created by me and was for learning purposes only
I want to credit all of this to him as this git repository is a following of his tutorial explaining alot about REST.API authentification and connecting this backend to the front end and making everything connect. 

I have made multiple repositories which are for the purpose of breaking down the important sections of his lessons in manageable as well as note filled code for the purpose of review if I wanted to learn about something specific
## Usage

### Install dependencies
